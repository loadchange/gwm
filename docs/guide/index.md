# What is gwm.js?

gwm.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for generating watermarks in web applications. It provides a simple yet powerful way to add watermarks to your web pages, helping to protect sensitive information and track content distribution.

## Why Use Watermarks?

Watermarks serve several important purposes in web applications:

1. **Information Security**: Watermarks can indicate the confidentiality level of information, reminding users to handle the content with appropriate care.

2. **Leak Tracing**: By including user-specific information in watermarks, you can trace the source of leaked information.

3. **Copyright Protection**: Watermarks can help establish ownership and deter unauthorized copying of content.

4. **Brand Reinforcement**: Subtle watermarks can reinforce your brand identity across all content.

## Key Features

### Multiple Watermark Types

gwm.js supports three different types of watermarks:

- **Canvas**: Renders watermarks using the HTML5 Canvas API, offering good performance and compatibility.
- **SVG**: Creates watermarks using SVG, providing better scaling for high-resolution displays.
- **Element**: Generates watermarks using DOM elements, allowing for more complex content and styling.

### Anti-Tampering Protection

gwm.js includes built-in monitoring to detect and respond to attempts to remove or modify watermarks. When tampering is detected, the watermark is automatically regenerated.

- Text content and font settings
